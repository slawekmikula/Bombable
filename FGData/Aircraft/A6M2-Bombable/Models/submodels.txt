  <!-- Submodels are objects which can be dropped or launched from the user aircraft.
      The trigger is a boolean property, which you define, which when "true" causes
      the submodel to be released/launched. 
      A submodel will create an AIBallistic object which will follow a ballistic path.
      By default one submodel will be released when the corresponding trigger is "true".
      The initial conditions (IC) define the object's starting point (relative to the
      user aircraft's "reported position"), and its initial speed and direction
      (relative to the user aircraft).  If you want to release many similar objects
      with similar IC, then you may use the <repeat>, <delay> and <count> properties
      to define this.  The allowed properties are:

      <name>         The name of the submodel.
      <model>        The path to the visual model.
      <trigger>      The property which will act as the trigger. 
      <speed>        Initial speed, in feet/sec, relative to user aircraft.
      <repeat>       Set "true" if you want multiple releases of this submodel.
      <delay>        Time, in seconds, between repeated releases.
      <count>        Number of submodels available for multiple release.
      <slaved>       Not used yet.
      <x-offset>     Submodel's initial fore/aft position relative to user aircraft.  
                     Fore is positive.
      <y-offset>     Submodel's initial left/right position relative to user aircraft.  
                     Right is positive.
      <z-offset>     Submodel's initial up/down position relative to user aircraft.  
                     Up is positive.
      <yaw-offset>   Submodel's initial azimuth, in degrees, relative to user aircraft's
                     nose.  Right is positive.
      <pitch-offset> Submodel's initial elevation, in degrees, relative to user aircraft's
                     pitch.  Up is positive.
      <cd>           Coefficient of drag.  A value about 0.193 is reasonable for a bullet.                     
      <eda>          Equivalent Drag Area in ft squared.  The object is assumed to have a 
                     mass of 0.03 slugs and a drag coefficient of 0.295, and sea-level air
                     density is assumed.  Adjust the EDA to give the model the ballistics you need.
                     The default value is 0.007.
      <life>         Life span in seconds.  Default is 900.0.
      <buoyancy>     In ft/sec/sec.  Works opposite acceleration of gravity.  For example, if
                     set to 32 the submodel will feel no gravity. If greater than 32 the object
                     will rise. Default is 0.
      <wind>         Set to true if you want the submodel to react to the wind.  Default is "false".

According to Wikipedia the A6M2 used uses:


2× 7.7 mm (0.303 in) Type 97 machine guns in the engine cowling, with 500 rounds per gun. 
2× 20 mm Type 99 cannons in the wings, with 60 rounds per gun. 


The Type 97

For details, see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_97_machine_gun

The 7.7 mm ammo is essentially the same as the .303 (British) cartridge; see 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.7x58mm_Arisaka

 The bullet weight was 174 gr, muzzle velocity 724 m/s (2375 ft/s).  It fires 
500 round/min, with an effective range of 540 m and maximum range (indirect 
fire) of about 4500 yd.  It can fire 500 rounds per minute.

174 gr = 11.3 grams = 0.0249122356 lb.  At muzzle velocity it can travel 4500 yd 
in about 5.5 seconds but of course it isn't going at muzzle velocity after it 
leaves the muzzle . . . say lifetime of 15 seconds would be pretty much all we'd
need.  A shorter lifetime might help framerate in FG, as 15 definitely kills it 
when you have fired a lot of rounds - let's go with 7.5.

And 500 rounds per minute means 8.33 per second or a delay of 0.12 seconds.

I don't know what proportion of rounds were tracers.  One out of four seems a 
common proportion today. 

That would mean a tracer every 0.48 seconds and 125 tracers out of 500 rounds. 
Let's make the L and R gun timings just a bit different - if they are exactly 
synchronized it seems a bit fake.  

It was not possible to reload in the air, so let's include that bit of realism.

cd: the given value of 0.193 is probably pretty reasonable for a bullet or 
similarly shaped object traveling at less than 1000 ft/sec. http://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Drag_coefficient indicates cd of 0.295 for a bullet (subsonic, and with 
flat (ie not pointed or "ogive" frontal area). This reference gives values 
between about 0.15 and .225 for CD of a typical .308 bullet traveling at less 
than 1000 ft/sec: http://www.frfrogspad.com/extbal.htm 

eda is a complete guess; no data.


Type 99-1 cannon

Details: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_99_cannon

Rate of fire: 520 rounds/min  or a round every 0.115 seconds 
Muzzle velocity: 600 m/s (1970 ft/s) 
Caliber: 20 mm 
60 rounds

Type 99-2 cannon was introduced in 1942 and used in the A6M3 but apparently never in the A6M2.

Below is a helpful summary of the relative effectiveness of this cannon and ammo 
from http://eaw.wikispaces.com/Technical+Tools--Gun+Power

GUN 20mm Type 99-1
CARTRIDGE 20x72RB
RoF RPS 8
CARTRIDGE POWER 12
GUN POWER 108
GUN WEIGHT KG 24
GUN EFFICIENCY  4.5

CARTRIDGE 20x72RB
TYPE HE
ROUND WEIGHT 200
MV M/SEC 600
PROJECTILE WEIGHT GM 128
% HEI CONTENT  6
DAMAGE  123
POWER 12

128 grams = 0.282191696 pounds

Power is relative to rifle caliber rounds, which score a 1.  So this cannon is 
about 12 times as powerful (in terms of causing damage) as a rifle or small-
caliber machine gun round.  Most of this is due to increased mass compared with 
the small-caliber bullet, but about 20% of the increase is due to incorporation 
of incendiary material (high explosive, HE) in the round.

eda we'll assume is 4X the value for the .303 round.  So 0.00236354 x 4 = 0.00945416
